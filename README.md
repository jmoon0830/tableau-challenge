# tableau-challenge
I analyze Citibike data using Tableau.

Data:
My data uses two datasets: January 2020 data and August 2020 data.
My data was concatenated using python and combined into a single csv.

Phenomenon:
The first phenomenon I found was that the trip duration total, average, and count was higher in August than January. I found that although
the total was almost 4 times more in August, the count was only about 2 times higher. This meant that the average duration was higher in
August which is also proven through a visualization.

The second phenomenon compares the start and end locations in January and August. There is much more diverse end station locations in August which
could be due to the increased number of trip duration and higher count.

The third phenomenon which is related to the second phenomenon is the comparison of the popularity in starting and ending locations. The layered map
shows zip code boundaries and zip codes. The There seems to be a relatively equal popularity in the starting and ending locations as shown
by the size of the markers. But there is still an obvious increase in marker locations as proven in the first phenomenon.
